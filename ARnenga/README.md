## Prepare 3D model and AR marker

This AR is use Greeting Card. So, this 3D model is "Kagami Mochi". Because I'm Japanese.

This 3D model is refered by [The Models Resource](https://www.models-resource.com/mobile/digimonlinkz/model/21573/). But extension on this model is ".dae". So, need convert ".dae" to ".obj" and ".mtl".  Anyway, I used [online tool of convert 3D model](http://www.greentoken.de/onlineconv/).

AR marker is can create by [AR.js Marker Training](https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/marker-training/examples/generator.html). To improve the precision of Marker, Marker is need simple. For example, useless marker is complex character or image. Good marker is simple character. By the way, this marker in use this project is, character is "元旦", font is "Hiragino Kaku Gothic Standard" 60pt, Pattern Ratio is 7.50.
